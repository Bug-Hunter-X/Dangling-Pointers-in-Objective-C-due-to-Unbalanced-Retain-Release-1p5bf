The corrected code uses ARC or employs proper `retain`/`release` to avoid dangling pointers:

```objectivec
// Using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting):
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

// No dealloc method needed with ARC

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: "Hello"];
// No need to manually release obj. ARC handles memory.

// Or with manual memory management (less common now):
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: "Hello"];
[obj release]; // Correctly releases obj, dealloc is called.  myString is also correctly released. 
```

In the corrected code, if using manual memory management (MRC), the `dealloc` method ensures proper release of all owned objects before the object itself is deallocated.  Using ARC is generally recommended as it simplifies memory management and significantly reduces the likelihood of these errors.
