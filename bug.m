In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically regarding the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern equivalent using ARC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: "Hello"];
[obj release]; //Error prone! 
```

The problem is that `obj` releases the memory allocated for the object, but the allocated string (`myString`) is still retained by `obj`. Once `obj` is deallocated, the allocated string becomes a dangling pointer causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.  This is a classic example of an unbalanced `retain`/`release` that slips through manual memory management.
